  "summary": "Esophageal cancer is a group of cancers that affect the esophagus, the tube that connects the throat to the stomach. It is the eighth most frequently diagnosed cancer worldwide and a significant cause of cancer-related deaths. The prognosis is generally poor due to late presentation with advanced disease. Two main types are esophageal squamous-cell carcinoma (ESCC) and esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC).",
