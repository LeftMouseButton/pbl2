  "summary": "Myelodysplastic Syndromes (MDS) are a group of blood cancers in which immature blood cells in the bone marrow do not mature or become healthy blood cells and thus cannot do their jobs. In MDS, the bone marrow produces blood cells that are abnormal or immature (dysplastic) and unable to function properly. These cells may also die in the bone marrow or soon after entering the bloodstream. As a result, there are often not enough healthy blood cells to meet the body's needs.",
