  "summary": "Breast cancer is a cancer that develops from breast tissue, characterized by uncontrolled cell growth. It can manifest as a lump, changes in breast shape, skin dimpling, nipple inversion, or discharge. Advanced stages can lead to bone pain, swollen lymph nodes, shortness of breath, or jaundice. It is the most common invasive cancer in women globally and can also affect men.",
