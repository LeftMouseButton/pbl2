  "summary": "Cervical cancer is a type of cancer that develops in the cervix, the lower, narrow end of the uterus that opens into the vagina. It is caused by abnormal cell growth that can invade or spread to other parts of the body. Early stages are often asymptomatic, but later symptoms can include abnormal vaginal bleeding, pelvic pain, or pain during sexual intercourse. The vast majority of cases are linked to persistent genital human papillomavirus (HPV) infection.",
