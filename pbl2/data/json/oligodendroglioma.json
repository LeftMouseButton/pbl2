  "disease_name": "Oligodendroglioma",
  "synonyms": [
    "Oligodendroglioma, IDH-mutant, and 1p/19q-codeleted"
  ],
  "summary": "Oligodendrogliomas are a type of glioma believed to originate from oligodendrocytes or glial precursor cells. They primarily occur in adults but are also found in children, comprising about 5% of all central nervous system tumors. They are characterized by specific genetic alterations, including IDH mutations and 1p/19q co-deletion, which are associated with chemosensitivity and improved prognosis.",
  "causes": [
    "Unknown",
    "Viral cause (some studies suggest)",
    "NJDS gene mutation (69% correlation in one study)",
    "Irradiation of pituitary adenoma (single case report)"
  ],
  "risk_factors": [],
  "symptoms": [
    "Seizure activity (often the first symptom)",
    "Headaches associated with increased intracranial pressure",
    "Neurological deficits (e.g., visual loss, motor weakness, cognitive decline)",
    "Neuropsychological deficits (e.g., anxiety)"
  ],
  "diagnosis": [
    "Computed tomography (CT) scan",
    "Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan",
    "Brain biopsy",
    "Histopathologic examination",
    "Molecular diagnostics (e.g., IDH mutation testing, 1p/19q co-deletion analysis)",
    "Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH)",
    "Loss of heterozygosity (LOH) analysis",
    "Virtual karyotyping"
  ],
  "treatments": [
    "Watchful waiting",
    "Symptomatic treatment (anticonvulsants for seizures, steroids for brain swelling)",
    "Chemotherapy (e.g., temozolomide)",
    "Radiation therapy",
    "Neurosurgery (maximal safe resection)",
    "Stereotactic surgery (for small, early-diagnosed tumors)"
