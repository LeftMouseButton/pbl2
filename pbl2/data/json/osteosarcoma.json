  "synonyms": [
    "OS"
  ],
  "summary": "Osteosarcoma is a type of bone cancer that originates from bone-forming cells. It is the most common primary bone cancer in children and young adults, and also occurs in the elderly, often associated with underlying bone pathology like Paget's disease. It can also arise from soft tissues (extraskeletal osteosarcoma).",
  "causes": [
    "Genetic mutations",
    "Infestation with the parasite Spirocerca lupi (esophageal osteosarcoma)"
  ],
  "risk_factors": [
    "Paget's disease of bone",
    "Hereditary predisposition (e.g., in St. Bernard dogs)",
    "Spayed/neutered status (in dogs)",
    "Exposure to ionizing radiation (implicit from leukemia causes, though not explicitly stated for osteosarcoma)",
    "Prior chemotherapy (implicit from leukemia causes, though not explicitly stated for osteosarcoma)"
  ],
  "symptoms": [
    "Pain in the affected bone",

    "Easy bruising or bleeding (general cancer symptom)",
    "Pale skin (general cancer symptom)",

  ],
  "diagnosis": [
    "X-rays (initial imaging of choice)",
    "CT scan (for bony anatomy, cortex integrity, fracture, ossification, calcification)",
    "MRI scan (for soft tissue and medullary cavity)",
    "Bone biopsy (definitive method)",
    "Dental check-ups (for jaw osteosarcoma)",
    "Symmetrical widening of the periodontal ligament space (in jaw osteosarcoma)",
    "Chest X-ray (for lung metastases)",
