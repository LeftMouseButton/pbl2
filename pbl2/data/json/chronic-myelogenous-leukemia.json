  "summary": "Chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) is a cancer of the white blood cells, specifically a type of chronic leukemia characterized by the increased and unregulated growth of myeloid cells in the bone marrow and their accumulation in the blood. It is a clonal bone marrow stem cell disorder associated with the Philadelphia chromosome, a characteristic chromosomal translocation.",
