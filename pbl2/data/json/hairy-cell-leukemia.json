  "summary": "Hairy cell leukemia (HCL) is an uncommon hematological malignancy characterized by the accumulation of abnormal B lymphocytes, known as 'hairy cells', in the bone marrow, spleen, and lymph nodes. These abnormal cells interfere with the production of normal blood cells, leading to various complications. While HCL has an indolent course, patients frequently relapse, but with treatment, life expectancy is generally comparable to the general population.",
