  "summary": "Mesothelioma is a type of cancer that develops from the mesothelium, the thin layer of tissue lining internal organs. It most commonly affects the lining of the lungs and chest wall, but can also occur in the lining of the abdomen, heart sac, or testis sac. The disease is strongly linked to asbestos exposure, with symptoms often appearing decades after exposure.",
