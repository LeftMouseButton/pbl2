  "summary": "Plasma cell leukemia (PCL) is a plasma cell dyscrasia, a malignant degeneration of plasma cells. It is the most aggressive form of plasma cell malignancies, occurring either primarily or secondary to multiple myeloma. PCL is a serious, life-threatening, and therapeutically challenging disease.",
  "causes": [
    "Development of excessively high number of genetic abnormalities in plasma cells or their precursor B cells and plasmablasts",
    "Acquired genetic abnormalities including gene mutations, single nucleotide polymorphisms, deletions and duplications of gene parts or chromosomes, translocations, and changes in gene expression",
    "Abnormalities affecting Wnt signaling pathway, cell cycle regulation, RNA metabolism, protein folding, and cell adherence"

  "diagnosis": [
    "Presence of >2 billion plasma cells per liter of blood",
