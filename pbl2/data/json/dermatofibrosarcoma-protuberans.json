  "summary": "Dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans (DFSP) is a rare, locally aggressive malignant cutaneous soft-tissue sarcoma that develops in the connective tissue cells of the dermis. It is characterized by slow growth, a high rate of local recurrence, and a low metastatic potential. DFSP can resemble a bruise, birthmark, or pimple and is often found on the torso, but can occur anywhere on the body.",

    "Older age (most often arise in patients in their thirties, possibly due to diagnostic delay)"

  "symptoms": [
    "Firm area of skin",
    "Slow-growing tumor",
