  "summary": "Neuroendocrine tumors (NETs) are neoplasms that arise from cells of the endocrine and nervous systems. They can occur in various locations, most commonly in the intestine, pancreas, or lungs. NETs share common features such as secretory granules and the production of biogenic amines and polypeptide hormones. They are classified by tumor grade and anatomical origin, with subtypes ranging from well-differentiated to poorly differentiated carcinomas.",
