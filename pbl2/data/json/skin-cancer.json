  "summary": "Skin cancers are cancers that arise from the skin, occurring when skin cells grow uncontrollably, forming malignant tumors. They are the most commonly diagnosed form of cancer in humans, with primary causes linked to prolonged exposure to ultraviolet (UV) radiation.",
  "causes": [
    "Prolonged exposure to ultraviolet (UV) radiation from the sun",
    "Tanning devices",
    "UVB radiation via direct DNA damage (for BCC and SCC)",
    "UVA radiation via indirect DNA damage (for melanoma)",
    "Free radicals and reactive oxygen species",
    "HPV infections (increase risk of squamous-cell skin cancer)",
    "Congenital melanocytic nevi syndrome",
    "Chronic non-healing wounds (Marjolin's ulcers)",
    "Ionizing radiation (e.g., X-rays)",
    "Environmental carcinogens",
    "Artificial UV radiation (tanning beds)",
    "Alcohol consumption (excessive drinking)",
    "Immunosuppressive medications (e.g., Cyclosporin A, azathioprine)",
    "Deliberate exposure of sensitive skin to sunlight"
  ],
  "risk_factors": [
    "Light skin color",
    "Older age",
    "Smoking tobacco",
    "Nevi larger than 20 mm",
    "Fair skin",
    "Prolonged history of sunburns",
    "Family history of skin cancer",
    "People with lighter skin",
    "Poor immune function (e.g., from medications or HIV/AIDS)",
    "Xeroderma pigmentosum"
  ],
  "symptoms": [
    "Changes in the skin that do not heal",
    "Ulcering in the skin",
    "Discolored skin",
    "Changes in existing moles (jagged edges, enlargement, changes in color, texture, or bleeding)",
    "Painful lesion that itches or burns",
    "Large brownish spot with darker speckles",
    "Raised, smooth, pearly bump on sun-exposed skin (BCC)",
    "Small blood vessels within the tumor (telangiectasia) (BCC)",
    "Crusting and bleeding in the center of the tumor (BCC)",
    "Red, scaling, thickened patch on sun-exposed skin (SCC)",
    "Firm hard nodules with a scaly top (SCC)",
    "Ulceration and bleeding (SCC)",
    "Large mass (SCC, if untreated)",
    "Mole that has changed in size, shape, color, has irregular edges, has more than one color, is itchy or bleeds (melanoma)",
    "Pink, red or fleshy colored moles (amelanotic melanoma)",
    "Appearance of a new mole during adulthood",
    "Pain, itching, ulceration, redness around the site, or bleeding at the site of a mole",
    "Rapidly growing, non-tender red, purple or skin colored bumps (Merkel cell carcinomas)",
    "Cyst-like appearance (Merkel cell carcinomas)"
