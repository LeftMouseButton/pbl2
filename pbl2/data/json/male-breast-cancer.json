  "summary": "Male breast cancer (MBC) is a cancer that originates in the breasts of males. It accounts for less than 1% of new breast cancer cases worldwide. Knowledge of MBC is less extensive than for female breast cancer due to its lower incidence and exclusion from large-scale studies. Many evaluation and treatment strategies are adopted from female breast cancer, but MBC has distinct features.",
