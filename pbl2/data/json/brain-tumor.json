  "summary": "A brain tumor is a growth of abnormal cells in the tissues of the brain. They can be benign (non-cancerous) or malignant (cancerous). Primary brain tumors start in the brain, while secondary (metastatic) tumors spread from elsewhere in the body. Symptoms vary based on size, location, and growth rate, and can include headaches, seizures, vision problems, vomiting, mental changes, difficulty with movement or speech, and behavioral changes. Diagnosis typically involves medical examination, imaging (MRI, CT scans), and biopsy. Treatment may include surgery, radiation therapy, chemotherapy, and targeted therapy.",
