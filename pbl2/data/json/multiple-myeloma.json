  "summary": "Multiple myeloma is a cancer of plasma cells, a type of white blood cell that normally produces antibodies. It is characterized by the proliferation of abnormal plasma cells, which can lead to various complications affecting bones, kidneys, blood, and the immune system. While generally incurable, it is treatable with remissions possible.",
