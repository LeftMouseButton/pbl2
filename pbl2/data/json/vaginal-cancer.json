  "summary": "Vaginal cancer is a rare form of cancer that develops in the tissue of the vagina. Primary vaginal cancer originates from the vaginal tissue, most frequently squamous cell carcinoma, but primary vaginal adenocarcinoma, sarcoma, and melanoma have also been reported. Secondary vaginal cancer involves the metastasis of a cancer that originated in a different part of the body and is more common. It occurs more frequently in women over age 50, with a mean age of diagnosis of 60 years, and can often be cured if found and treated in early stages.",
