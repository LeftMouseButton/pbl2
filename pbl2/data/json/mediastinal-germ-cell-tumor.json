  "summary": "Mediastinal germ cell tumors are tumors that derive from germ cell rest remnants in the mediastinum. They are uncommon, representing only 3 to 10% of tumors originating in the mediastinum. Malignant mediastinal tumors are usually symptomatic at the time of diagnosis and cause symptoms by compressing or invading adjacent structures.",
  "causes": [
    "Abnormal migration of germ cells during embryogenesis",
    "Widespread distribution of germ cells to multiple sites during normal embryogenesis"

  "risk_factors": [
    "Young males"

  "symptoms": [
    "Compression of adjacent structures (lungs, pleura, pericardium, chest wall)",
    "Invasion of adjacent structures (lungs, pleura, pericardium, chest wall)",
    "Large tumor size",
    "Minimal symptomatology with large tumors (seminomas)"
