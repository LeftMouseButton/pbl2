  "summary": "Adenoid cystic carcinoma (ACC) is a rare type of cancer that can occur in various body sites, most commonly in the salivary glands. It is the third-most common malignant salivary gland tumor overall and the most common malignant salivary gland tumor in the submandibular region. ACC is generally well-differentiated and slow-growing, allowing patients to survive for years with metastases, though late-occurring metastatic disease can be fatal.",
