  "summary": "Astrocytoma is a type of brain tumor originating from astrocytes, a type of glial cell in the cerebrum. It typically does not spread outside the brain and spinal cord. Astrocytomas are the second most common type of glioma after glioblastomas and can occur in most parts of the brain and occasionally the spinal cord. They are classified into two broad classes: those with narrow zones of infiltration (mostly noninvasive) and those with diffuse zones of infiltration (high-grade).",
