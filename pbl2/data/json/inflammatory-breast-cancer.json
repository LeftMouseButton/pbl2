  "summary": "Inflammatory breast cancer (IBC) is a rare and aggressive type of breast cancer characterized by cancer cells blocking lymph vessels in the skin of the breast, leading to a warm, red, and swollen appearance. It often presents without detectable lumps and can mimic skin inflammation like mastitis. IBC is typically diagnosed at a later stage and has a poorer prognosis than other breast cancers, though recent advances in therapy have improved survival rates.",
