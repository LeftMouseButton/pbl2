  "summary": "Lymphoma is a group of blood and lymph tumors that develop from lymphocytes, a type of white blood cell. It is a broad category encompassing many subtypes, with the two main classifications being non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) and Hodgkin lymphoma (HL). Lymphomas are part of the broader group of tumors of hematopoietic and lymphoid tissues.",
