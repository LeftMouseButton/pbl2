  "summary": "Hodgkin lymphoma (HL) is a cancer that develops in the lymph system, a part of the immune system. It is characterized by the presence of multinucleated Reed–Sternberg cells in the lymph nodes and affects a subgroup of white blood cells called lymphocytes. It is one of the main types of lymphoma, distinct from non-Hodgkin lymphoma.",
