  "summary": "Medulloblastoma is a common type of primary malignant brain cancer in children, originating in the cerebellum or posterior fossa. It is an invasive, rapidly growing tumor that spreads through cerebrospinal fluid and can metastasize to the brain and spinal cord. Historically classified as a PNET, it is now recognized as distinct.",
