  "summary": "Retinoblastoma is a rare, rapidly developing cancer of the immature cells of the retina, the light-detecting tissue of the eye. It is the most common primary malignant intraocular cancer in children, with most cases detected in those under 3 years old. While survival rates are high in developed countries, vision loss or eye removal can occur.",
