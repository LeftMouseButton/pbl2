  "summary": "Gestational trophoblastic disease (GTD) is a group of rare pregnancy-related tumors that occur when cells in the womb start to proliferate uncontrollably. These tumors arise from trophoblasts, the cells that form the placenta. GTD can range from benign to malignant and can sometimes simulate pregnancy.",
