  "disease_name": "Anaplastic thyroid cancer",
  "synonyms": [
    "Anaplastic thyroid carcinoma",
    "ATC"
  ],
  "summary": "Anaplastic thyroid cancer (ATC) is an aggressive and uncommon form of thyroid cancer characterized by the uncontrolled growth of highly abnormal cells in the thyroid gland. It accounts for a small percentage of thyroid cancer cases but is responsible for a disproportionately high number of deaths due to its aggressive behavior and resistance to treatments. ATC often dedifferentiates from pre-existing differentiated thyroid cancer, leading to poor prognosis and a median survival time of a few months.",
  "causes": [
    "Dedifferentiation from differentiated thyroid cancer"
  ],
  "risk_factors": [
    "Age over sixty",
    "Long-standing goiter",
    "Repeated radiation exposure to the chest or neck",
    "Being a woman",
    "Being Asian",
    "Exposure to radiation treatments to head or neck as a child",
    "Radiation emergency exposure",
    "Certain genetic conditions (e.g., multiple endocrine neoplasia)",
    "Family history of thyroid cancer or thyroid disease"

    "Symptoms from distant metastases (e.g., to the brain)",
    "Coughing up blood (rare)",
    "Lump (nodule) in the neck",
    "Pain when swallowing"
  ],
  "diagnosis": [
    "Fine-needle aspiration biopsy",
    "Microscopic examination of thyroid tissue",
    "Immunohistochemistry testing (keratin, p53, PAX8 positive; thyroid transcription factor-1, thyroglobulin, calcitonin negative)",
    "High levels of PD-L1 expression",
    "BRAF and TERT mutations",
    "Physical exam (checking neck for swelling, lumps)",
    "Medical history",
    "Thyroid tests",
    "Other blood or imaging tests",
    "Ultrasound imaging (hypoechoic mass with invasion of local structures)",
    "Contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) scan of the neck (if surgery planned)",
    "PET scan (for staging)",
    "CT scan of neck, chest, abdomen, and pelvis (if PET unavailable)",
    "Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain (to assess for distant metastases)"
  ],
  "treatments": [
    "Surgery (often unresectable)",
    "Radiation therapy (external beam radiotherapy, EBRT)",
    "Chemotherapy",
    "Targeted therapy (e.g., BRAF and MEK inhibitors like dabrafenib and trametinib, vemurafenib and cobimetinib)",
    "Immunotherapy (e.g., atezolizumab, pembrolizumab, spartalizumab)",
    "Combinatorial therapy (molecular-based)",
    "Thyroid hormone therapy",
    "Radioactive iodine therapy (typically ineffective)",
    "Supportive care (e.g., tracheostomy)",
    "Palliative treatment",
    "Watchful waiting (less common for ATC)"
