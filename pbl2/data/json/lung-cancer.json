  "summary": "Lung cancer is a malignant tumor that originates in the tissues of the lungs, typically in the cells lining the air passages. It is the leading cause of cancer death worldwide. The disease is primarily caused by genetic damage to lung cells, often induced by inhaling toxic substances like cigarette smoke. Damaged cells multiply uncontrollably, forming tumors that can spread within the lungs and metastasize to other parts of the body, impairing lung function and eventually leading to death if untreated. There are two main types: small cell lung cancer (SCLC) and non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), which differ in their growth patterns and treatment responses.",
