  "summary": "Meningioma is a typically slow-growing tumor that forms from the meninges, the membranous layers surrounding the brain and spinal cord. They can be benign, atypical, or malignant. Most cases are sporadic, but some are familial. They are more common in women and older adults. Meningiomas represent about 30% of brain tumors in adults.",
