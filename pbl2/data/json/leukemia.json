  "summary": "Leukemia is a group of blood cancers that typically start in the bone marrow and result in the production of large numbers of abnormal blood cells, often referred to as blasts or leukemia cells. These abnormal cells are not fully developed and can crowd out healthy blood cells, impairing their functions. Symptoms arise from the lack of normal blood cells and can include bleeding, bruising, bone pain, fatigue, fever, and an increased susceptibility to infections. Diagnosis is usually confirmed through blood tests and bone marrow biopsies.",
