  "summary": "Liposarcomas are a type of soft tissue sarcoma that arise from fat cells. They are the most common subtype of soft tissue sarcomas in adults. Liposarcomas can occur in various locations throughout the body, including deep and superficial tissues, as well as less accessible sites like the retroperitoneum and abdominal cavity. They are classified into five main forms: atypical lipomatous tumor/well-differentiated liposarcoma, dedifferentiated liposarcoma, myxoid liposarcoma, pleomorphic liposarcoma, and myxoid pleomorphic liposarcoma. While some forms are considered less aggressive, all can infiltrate locally, recur after surgery, and potentially metastasize.",
  "causes": [
    "Genetic mutations (e.g., amplification of MDM2 and CDK4 genes)",
    "Translocations involving FUS-DDIT3 or EWSR1-DDIT3 fusion genes (in myxoid liposarcoma)",
    "Inactivation of RB1 tumor suppressor gene (in myxoid pleomorphic liposarcoma)"
