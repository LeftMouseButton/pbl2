  "disease_name": "Astroblastoma",
  "synonyms": [],
  "summary": "Astroblastoma is a rare glial tumor derived from the astroblast, a type of cell that closely resembles spongioblastoma and astrocytes. It is most likely found in the supratentorial region of the brain, including the cerebrum, frontal lobe, parietal lobe, and temporal lobe, but can also occur in other brain areas. It accounts for a small percentage of all brain gliomas and is considered challenging to diagnose and treat.",
