  "summary": "Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) is a type of chronic leukemia where the bone marrow makes abnormal lymphocytes (a type of white blood cell). These abnormal cells crowd out healthy cells, leading to infection, anemia, and easy bleeding. The abnormal cells can also spread outside the blood to other parts of the body. CLL usually gets worse slowly and is one of the most common types of leukemia in adults, often occurring during or after middle age.",
