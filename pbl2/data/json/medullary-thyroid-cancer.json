  "summary": "Medullary thyroid cancer is a form of thyroid carcinoma originating from the parafollicular cells (C cells) of the thyroid gland, which produce the hormone calcitonin. It is the third most common type of thyroid cancer, accounting for about 3% of all cases. Approximately 25% of MTC cases are genetic, caused by mutations in the RET proto-oncogene, and can be associated with multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2 (MEN2). Sporadic MTC accounts for the remaining 75% of cases.",
