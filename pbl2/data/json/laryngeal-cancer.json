  "summary": "Laryngeal cancer is a type of cancer that develops in any part of the larynx (voice box). It is typically a squamous-cell carcinoma. The prognosis is affected by the location of the tumor, which is divided into three anatomical regions: the glottis, the supraglottis, and the subglottis. Laryngeal cancer can spread by direct extension, metastasis to regional cervical lymph nodes, or via the bloodstream. It is considered a rare disease.",
