  "summary": "Pheochromocytoma is a rare tumor of the adrenal gland that produces excess catecholamines, leading to symptoms such as hypertension, headaches, and palpitations. It can also occur outside the adrenal glands as a paraganglioma. While often benign, a small percentage can be malignant. Diagnosis relies on biochemical tests and imaging, and treatment typically involves surgical removal of the tumor.",
