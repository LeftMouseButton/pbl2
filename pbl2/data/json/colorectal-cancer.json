  "summary": "Colorectal cancer is a cancer that develops in the tissues of the colon or rectum, which are parts of the large intestine. It is caused by uncontrolled growth of colon cells that can invade and spread to other parts of the body. It often starts as a benign polyp and can be diagnosed through colonoscopy and medical imaging. Screening is effective for prevention and reducing deaths.",
