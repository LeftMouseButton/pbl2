  "summary": "Epithelioid hemangioendothelioma (EHE) is a rare vascular cancer that is intermediate between angiosarcoma and hemangioma, but genetically distinct. It is a soft tissue sarcoma originating from endothelial cells and can occur in organs throughout the body, most frequently in the liver, lungs, bones, and skin. EHE typically has an indolent course, but can occasionally present as high-grade and aggressive.",
